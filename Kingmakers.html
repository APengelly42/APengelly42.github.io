                        <p>I have always had an interest in politics. Although my allegiances have<br />
						changed from election to election, I have also had an interest in the<br />
						process itself.  The machinations of how someone is elected leader of<br />
						their political party, and then as leader of their province/country<br />
						has always held some interest for me.</p>
						
						<p>So it caught my attention one day when I saw that my friend Ed Brown<br />
						was writing about the Ontario PC Leadership race, and how with it's<br />
						convoluted system, it put all of the power into the hands of ridings<br />
						with smaller amounts of votes.</p>
						
						<p>I decided to do a deeper dive into the methodology of how the PCs in Ontario<br />
						(and in Canada) decide on who their leader is.  I guess my study of<br />
						how leaders were chosen had slipped! I remember the days of leadership<br />
						conventions from the past with multiple rounds of voting.  Someone would<br />
						be eliminated and then the race would be on to garner the support of the<br />
						eliminated candidates supporters.  It could be a long and yes, sometimes<br />
						dreary affair. I assumed that was still the way the voting was done - but once<br />
						I did the research I came to realize how wrong I was!</p>
						
						<p>At the current time the PC party of Ontario (and Canada) uses a ranked<br />
						ballot in deciding the leadership of the party. When indicating your<br />
						choice for leader of the party you can also indicate a second or third<br />
						choice. All of the long hours waiting for voting and counting to happen<br />
						at past leadership conventions is a thing of the past.  Votes for each<br />
						round can be tabulated quickly, the lowest point getter is eliminated,<br />
						and then the next round can be tabulated, until a winner is determined.</p>
						
						<p>At this point, it looks like a good system from a standpoint of how<br />
						many hours and how much expense is saved in the process of selecting<br />
						the leader. But, in the purview of making things "fair" the PCs have<br />
						introduced a wrinkle to the system - each riding only gets a maximum<br />
						of 100 "points" towards the vote. If 100 members or less from that<br />
						riding vote then each vote is counted as 1 point towards the candidate<br />
						(This happened in 3 of the 124 ridings in the 2018 leadership vote - all<br />
						all of them from Northern Ontario). For ridings with over 100 voters<br />
						then the 100 points are allocated on a percentage basis.  40% of the<br />
						vote in that riding translates into 40 points. Individual members in<br />
						ridings like Don Valley West that have a large voting base (1,334<br />
						members voted in the leadership	race) have much less say than an<br />
						individual in a riding with a small	membership base like Humber River -<br />
						Black Creek (159 members voted).</p>
						
						<p>Looking at the face of it, something seemed funny to me about<br />
						weighting the votes by riding.  Especially since ridings are<br />
						designed to have approximately the same number of people in them.<br />
						Wikipedia states that the Don Valley West riding had a population<br />
						of 123,200 in 2011, and Humber River - Black Creek had a population<br />
						of 108,198.  Don Valley West having 13.8% more people does not<br />
						explain why 8.4 times the number of people voted in the leadership<br />
						race from Don Valley West than from Humber River - Black Creek.</p>
						
						<p>I started looking at whether the ridings with less voters in<br />
						the PC leadership race did have an effect on the overall winner<br />
						of the race. The leadership race was a very tight one. Once the<br />
                        final round was complete, Doug Ford won by 153 points (1.24% of<br />
                        all the points).  On an actual vote basis, Christine Elliott<br />
                        received 3.47% more of the ballots cast, so Doug Ford was<br />
                        definitely able to take advantage of the points from areas<br />
                        where there were a smaller number of votes cast.</p>

                        <p>Once I was able to gather the raw numbers (from Wikipedia), I<br />
                        did an analysis of where the points for each candidate came from.<br />
                        Looking at each region, I came to the realization that the 14 ridings<br />
						from Northern Ontario were effectively a wash. Elliott won the whole<br />
                        region by 5.77 points.  No candidate won any riding in the region<br />
                        by more than 24 points.  I decided to leave the region out of the<br />
                        analysis to be able to drill down further in Southern Ontario.</p>

                        <p>One of the first analyses that I did was a look at cumulative<br />
                        points won for each candidate when sorting the ridings by number<br />
                        of votes cast.  I think it tells an interesting tale:</p>

                        <img src = "PC vs Ont - 3.png"> 						
						
						<p></p>
						
						<p>For the top 51 ridings by numbers of votes cast Elliott had 54%<br />
						of the points.  Over the next 53 ridings Ford collected 51.7% of the<br />
						points, but then in the 13 ridings with the smallest number of votes<br />
						all of them had a Ford majority, and gave him 65.9% of their points.<br />
						This group of ridings represented only 4.6% of the votes cast, but it<br />
						swung the election.  Outside of these ridings Ford lost by 267.65 points<br />
						but within these 13 ridings he gained 414.2 points to win the race.<br />
						
						<p>There are various reasons why Ford could have won these areas<br />
						by such a great margin.  Possibly the Ford campaign was better at<br />
						targeting these ridings that were going to have an overweighted<br />
						effect on the final results.  The hypothesis that I came away with<br />
						still bothered me though - I believed that the reason why these ridings<br />
						we so under represented by membership votes was due to them being in<br />
                        ridings where there is not a large amount of PC support.  If that is<br />
                        the case, then the PCs are giving the power of "kingmaking" to the<br />
                        members in ridings where there is minimal chance of a PC being elected!</p>

                        <p>I was able to find the latest projections of how the Ontario<br />
                        provincial election is going to turn out on <a href="http://www.tooclosetocall.ca">www.tooclosetocall.ca</a>.<br />
                        Once I compiled the data from the PC leadership vote and the Ontario<br />
                        election projections I was able to come up with this chart:</p>

       					<img src = "PC vs Ont - 1.png">	
						
						<p></p>
						
						<p>The bottom left corner was very interesting to me.  Zooming in<br />
						we get the following points:</p>
						
						<img src = "PC vs Ont - 2.png">
						
						<p></p>
						
						<p>The points represented are 9 different ridings: Davenport, Hamilton Centre<br />
                        Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, Hamilton Mountain, Humber River—Black Creek,<br />
                        London—Fanshawe, Windsor West, Windsor—Tecumseh and York South—Weston.<br />
						All of the ridings have a snowball's chance in hell of having a PC<br />
						candidate elected in the Ontario election, yet these 9 ridings when<br />
						given equal weighting under the PC leadership election scheme gave<br />
						275 points more to Ford than to Elliott - more than enough to swing<br />
						the leadership to Ford.</p>
						
						<p>The way the PC leadership elections are run leads to the real<br />
						possibility that the leadership is decided by the areas where there<br />
						is no real support for the PCs in general.  Just this scenario seems<br />
						to have happened in the PC leadership election in 2018.  This has<br />
						made the PC members in these 9 ridings the unlikely kingmakers that<br />
						may have chosen the next premier of Ontario.
